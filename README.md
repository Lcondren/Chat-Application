## Chat Application

### **About the Project**
This project involved building two Java applications, a chat client application and a chat server application which can pass messages back and forth over a local host connection. Both applications may be executed from the command line.


### **Project Details**
- Utilises Java Socket API
- Utilises Java Multithreading (Chat Server Listens For Connections and Calls New Threads for Each Established Connection)

### Tools used ###
- Intellij IDE
- Java

#### Instructions to run the Programme:
1.	Run the Server class in Java first, it will bring up a blank screen on the console

2.	Run the client class, this can be run as many times as you like to have many different clients on the server, they will be prompt to enter in their username for the group chat

The design of the programme I used three classes:

1.	The Server Class – to set up the Server and the port to be used for when clients are looking to join 
2.	The Client Class -  to set up clients that can access the server, let them type in their names, allow them to write messages on the server, by using Threads with Client Handler
3.	The ClientHandler Class – to set up the threads, allow the messages from the clients be read in the server by using a BufferedReader
